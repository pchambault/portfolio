::: {#center}
I am a marine biologist interested into the movement ecology and ecophysiology of marine megafauna species, from marine mammals to sea turtles. By using satellite tracking and biologging devices, I investigate the relationships between the distribution-diving behavior of these highly mobile animals and their environment, particularly in relation to oceanographic features.
